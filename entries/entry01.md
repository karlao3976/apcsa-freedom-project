My name is Karla Osorno, I am currently a senior at HSTAT. I am taking the APCSA course as my last year of SEP.

The past few fridays in class we've had to explore different tools to learn for our year long project, known as the freedom project. I've been struggling a little bit with this because our teacher, Mr. Mueller, told us to think of a problem we want to solve so we can then find a tool to help us solve that problem. The only problem I've been having is that I wasn't too sure what problem I wanted to solve.

So far in class, I've just been going through the list of tools that Mr. Mueller provided for us and I've been trying to find something that interests me. The only tools that really caught my attention are **Swift** and **cybersecurity**.

I've talked to many of my peers about their ideas for the freedom project and they all seemed to have great ideas and I felt completely lost because I had no idea what I was doing. I had settled on maybe creating a cybersecurity program or maybe collaborating with one of my classmates on an idea one of them had.

Then, *the* idea finally came to me.

It was a lazy Saturday, I was at home and I happened to be texting one of my friends. She was telling me that she wanted to have a party for her birthday and that she was worried about the stress that would come from planning. This is when the thought came to me, I could create an *app* that would make it easier to plan parties and events.

This made me really excited because it was something I was passionate about. I love the atmosphere that comes from parties. In many Latin American countries, it is common for girls to celebrate their fifteenth birthday through a big party known as a *quincea√±era*.

I've been to these parties because many of my family members and friends have had these celebrations. It's a beautiful moment because everyone comes together and has a great time dancing, celebrating, and enjoying food.

My idea for the app would be to provide easy party and event planning by providing the user with help finding available venues, caterers, comparing prices, invitation makers, and so much more.

I got extremely excited for this idea because I know how stressful the planning process could be, not to mention how expensive it is!

Mr. Mueller mentioned how creating an app usually requires partnership because it is too much for one person to handle. I decided to ask my peer and friend, Osvaldo, if he would like to help me with this project. I told him my idea and he said it sounded good, now we have decided to collaborate together.

I am planning to incorporate Swift since I know you need this to create an IOS app. So far in the Engineering Design Process, we are up to defining the problem. Osvaldo and I plan to research our problem and the tools we need to help solve it.

I have high hopes for our project and hope that it will turn out successful.
