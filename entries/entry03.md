Since my previous blog entry, Melanie and I have continued to learn Swift. At the beginning of our partnership, we agreed to learn Swift before we started to work on our final project. We have been using a [website](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui) to teach us how to build a complete app with multiple features. So far we have been going through the videos of "building a complete project". Once we are confident enough in using Swift, we will use our skills to build our own HSTAT app.

**Engineering Design Process(EDP)**
So far, Melanie and I are in the researching step of the EDP. We have been working on our research by researching more resources to help us with Swift. For example, we have been using the videos from [hacking with swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui) as a reference. WE have also found [turorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/index.htm) to use as a reference for learning Swift. Our final project would ideally be an app to help people in HSTAT to communicate with fellow peers and staff to stay connected to our school. We hope that by learning Swift we could create our app.

**Knowledge**
The knowledge I previously had with designing websites in 11th grade ended up being a good starting point when learning Xcode. In 11th grade, we learned about web design using languages such as HTML and CSS. In a simple example, last year, I used a navigation bar for many of the websites I created. These navigation bars require "lists" so that the user can click on each list item to navigate them somewhere specifically on the website. A navbar list example in HTML can be:

```HTML
<ul>
  <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="#news">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the `ul` represents an unordered list and the `li` represents each list item. While learning this in Swift, I found that the code was really similar. Here is an example:

```Swift
NavigationView{
            List{
                Text("home")
                Text("news")
                Text("contact")
                Text("about")
            }.navigationBarTitle("title")
```

I found this really interesting because although I don't have much experience with Swift, I felt like I had an advantage while learning it because it is similar to languages I have learned in the past.

**Skills**
One of the skills that I have learned is _attention to detail_ while I was watching one of hacking with Swift's tutorials. I was so confused on a specific part when the instructor was showing how to set up the menu for his app. I had to keep rewatching the same part of a video until I understood it. My code wasn't working like his, and I later discovered that the reason why my code was failing was becasue I put the line of code in the wrong section by mistake.
Another skill that I have developed is _how to learn_ by learning on my own. Although I am working with a partner, it's not the same as having a teacher to help me. The code that Melanie and I are working on is independent for us. We are learning on our own without relying on a teacher. Whenever we have a question, we turn to google for answers.
