### Sources
Throughout the progress of working on our Yellowjackets app, Melanie and I used different sources to help us learn Swift. The website [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui) provided many useful videos to help us get started with learning Swift. At the beginning of the year when we were still getting used to Swift, we used the meal planning app tutorial on their website as a reference to help us understand how IOS apps were created and customized.

### Engineering Design Process
On the engineering design process I would say we have reached the stage where we have to improve as needed. We had a plan to add notifications for students to get about posts made by the staff, and creating student or teacher specific accounts, which we did not get to reach. So if we were to continue to improve our app, it would be to include these features.

### Knowledge
While creating the app, a Github repo was necessary to have in order to share the Xcode project. Learning how to use Github and repos proved to be useful when creating this project.

### Skills
One of the skill that I have improved while working on the freedom project was **how to learn**. This is a skill that was very important because I had to google, watch videos, and look at code to build our app. I needed to understand how to build the app, so I would often search any questions I had on google, or I would rewatch parts of videos to understand how certain things worked. This goes beyond just the freedom project because this skill will be very useful in college and in the future.
Another skill I improved was **embracing failure**. This was something I struggled a lot with a first. Since we built it from scratch, it was very frustrating trying to fix the mistake when they were very small. There were a few times when I wasn't sure what was wrong with the code. I stepped away for a little from the project, then returned the next day and I was refreshed and able to work through my problems. Embracing failure is a very important skill that I will continue to work on and I believe this freedom project has helped me with it.
