# Entry 2
##### 11/18/19

A *few* things have changed since I made my last blog entry. In my last blog entry, I mentioned that I was going to work with my classmate Osvaldo on creating an event planning app. We had a few complications when he tried getting set up with Swift, which is the code needed to create an IOS app. Osvaldo decided to work by himself on a different tool and project, while I partnered up with someone else, Melanie.

We plan on making an app for the students and teachers at HSTAT to become involved about events and other things that are going on at school.

So far, Melanie and I have been learning a few basics of Swift, such as printing and variables, from an app called **Code Swift**. We also found a tutorial for making an app on Swift. This is the [link](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) to the tutorial.

So far in the engineering design process, Melanie and I have already defined our problem. The problem is that not many HSTAT students are involved in the school community, and sometimes it is because they don't know of the events that are going on in our school. We hope to fix this by creating the HSTAT app where many students and teachers will be able to communicate with each other and stay updated on news at our school. We are researching the problem using Swift and tinkering with it. We are working on improving our skills in this language and being able to learn how to create our app.

The knowledge I am using is my knowledge about Java from the work we do everyday. Swift is very similar to Java. Swift has _arrays, variables, strings, integers,_ etc. I feel like knowing other languages such as Java is an advantage to learning Swift because I am already familiar with the material.

The skill I have used and developed so far is _how to google_. Since this is a __LOYO__ project, it is important that we depend on ourselves and on our peers to develeop knowledge. I have searched up tutorials, textbooks, and videos that provide information about Swift that will help me in creating this project. _Communication_ is also another skill I am developing in this project. Since I am working with a partner, I have communicated with Melanie my ideas and notes to help each other out.
